Task Details
1)I learnd the decorator
2)I learnd the iterator
3)I see ganerator

challenges
1)The decorator was very difficult for me to understand, but with a lot of practice and code reading, I could almost understand it
2)I didn't understand the generator (that is, I only realized that it is a memory location that every time you call it, the complete program does not run, for example, it returns only one of the numbers)

next steps
see corotin and amalgar valros
see adrak
Conclusion
1)A decorator is a function that receives another function and executes them without changing the second operand.
2)Iterators are the same repeaters like (For and While), which must be used with the Next method.
